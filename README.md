While working in a tattoo shop myself, I noticed in the industry shops tend to use paper for everything from booking appointments, aftercare sheets,
and client forms. This leads to a lot of papers lying around the shop and it can get cluttered very quickly. I wanted to create a software that tattoo
shops can use to stay organized and make everything digital. I wanted to include a daily shop to-do list for chores that keep the shop running, a reminder
for shops to get their autoclaves tested for efficiency, a scheduler for artists to book appointments, and a document uploader to keep track of their
client's forms such as waivers and aftercare sheets. Eventually I would like to incorporate a way for artists to have their own individual profiles to login
to so they can keep track of their clients instead of mixing with other artists at the shop. I also want to include a payment system for shops that take
credit cards.
